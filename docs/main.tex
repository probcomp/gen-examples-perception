\title{Combining custom deep learning and Monte Carlo for inference in probabilistic programs}

\begin{document}

\section{Background: Programmable Inference in Probabilistic Programs}
Introduce GenLite.

\subsection{Generative Functions}
Introduce generative functions.

\subsection{Using Generative Functions to Define Proposal Distributions}
Like probabilistic models, we represent proposals as probabilistic programs.
Proposal programs can be used in importance sampling, sequential Monte Carlo, and Markov chain Monte Carlo.
Proposal programs can include latent variables.

\subsection{Training Proposal Distributions on Simulated Data}
Proposal programs can be used on simulated data (cite the `probabilitsic programs as proposals' research).
Proposal programs can be trained for use as importance distributions or MCMC proposals.
Show the math for training (KL divergence and maximum likelihood).
Discuss static parameters.

\section{Scalable Deep Learning in GenLite using TensorFlow}
About the implementation.
GenLite is embedded in Julia.
TensorFlow functions, which have inputs and outputs and parameters.
Discuss the reverse-mode AD integration.
Discuss vectorized (batched) training.

\section{Combining Monte Carlo Inference and Deep Learning Proposals}
Because GenLite provides programmable inference, we can combine deep neural network proposals with other Monte Carlo strategies, like random walk moves, for refining a hypothesis.
