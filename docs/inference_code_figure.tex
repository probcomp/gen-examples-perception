\caption{
Performing inference in the generative model of Figure~\ref{fig:model-code-figure} using a combination of deep learning and model-based Monte Carlo.
Having trained the proposal distribution (\texttt{proposal}) we use it as an importance distribution in a sampling-importance-resampling algorithm.
The GenLite API function \infr{\texttt{importance4}} samples from an importance distribution, then applies a trace bijection to obtain a new trace, and treats the resulting trace as a proposed trace for the model.
In this case, the bijection simply moves random choices that were nested under the address \addr{\texttt{"prediction"}} to the top level of the trace.
This example does not exercise the support for backward kernels, which can be used to implement auxiliary-variable importance samplers (thus \texttt{backward\_kernel} is empty).
